How does Income Level, Education, Marital Status and Age Affect the Acceptance of Coupons for Cheap Restaurants and More Expensive Restaurants?

<h3>Coupons Acceptance Report</h3>


One of the most interesting findings was comparing income to the coupon acceptance of cheap restaurants and more expensive restaurants.
The cheap restaurants were accepted more often for all income levels, but one thing that I thought was most interesting was that the higher incomes were not as interested in coupons for restaurants as the mid-range income levels.

When looking at marital status, it looked like single people with kids were the most likely to accept coupons.  This could be because it is more difficult financially for people raising kids without a partner.
I then noticed that the single people with kids accepted at a rate of 100% and that made me think that maybe there isn't a lot of data in that category.  Widowed people were the least likely to accept the coupon.  One could guess that they may not go out as often, but more research would need to be done to determine that.

When I looked further, I realized that there were only 3 people in the dataset who were single and had kids in the car when the coupon was distributed, so this might not be enough data to make a good conclusion about single people with kids.  As shown in this image, the vast majority of people who had kids in the car were married.

The acceptance rate for education level is lower for the highest level in the dataset which is Graduate level.  This may correlate with income where the highest levels don't have as much of a need to use coupons.

Acceptance rates for age don't seem to have a significant difference.  Acceptance rates are fairly steady across the different age groups for both the cheap restaurants and the more expensive restaurants.

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

Perhaps the people who pay the most attention to coupons are the ones who have to be most careful with their money.  High-income individuals used coupons for cheap restaurants 30% less than mid-income groups.  Education levels correlate with the income levels.  People with kids in the car accepted coupons at higher rates.

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

I would recommend marketing focused on people who need to save money.  I would not spend as much money on the higher income brackets. 
Marketing to people with families, and middle income families may be a good target.  
I would also recommend studying the single parent group as it had a 100% acceptance rate in this sample. A larger sample size would be needed to determine if this group is indeed a group that could be targeted for coupon acceptance.
