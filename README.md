How does Income Level, Education, and Marital Status and Age Effect the Acceptance of Coupons for Cheap Restaurants and More Expensive Restaurants?

Coupons Acceptance Report


One of the most interesting findings was comparing income to the coupon acceptance of cheap restaurants and more expensive restaurants.
The cheap restaurants were accepted more often for all income levels, but one thing that I thought was most interesting was that the higher incomes were not as interested in coupons for restaurants as the mid-range income levels.

When looking at marital status, it looked like single people with kids were the most likely to accept coupons.  This could be because it is more difficult financially for people raising kids without a partner.
I then noticed that the single people with kids accepted at a rate of 100% and that made me think that maybe there isn't a lot of data in that category.  Widowed people were the least likely to accept the coupon.  One could guess that they may not go out as often, but more research would need to be done to determine that.

When I looked further, I realized that there were only 3 people in the dataset who were single and had kids in the car when the coupon was distributed, so this might not be enough data to make a good conclusion about single people with kids.  As shown in this image, the vast majority of people who had kids in the car were married.

I also explored the education level of drivers who accepted coupons.

The acceptance rate for education level is lower for the highest level in the dataset which is Graduate level.  This may correlate with income where the highest levels don't have as much of a need to use coupons.

Age is also a big factor in comparing this data.  The younger people in the database are more likely to accept restaurant coupons.

Perhaps the people who pay the most attention to coupons are the ones who have to be most careful with their money.  Higher incomes accepted coupons for cheap restaurants at a lower rate than people with mid and low incomes.  Education levels correlate with the income levels.  People with kids in the car accpted
